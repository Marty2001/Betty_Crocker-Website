                    <p>The Minneapolis suburb of Golden Valley, Minnesota, where General Mills is headquartered, has a street named Betty Crocker Drive.
                        There are a number of Betty Crocker-branded products, including plastic food containers and measuring cups, and a line of
                        small appliances such as popcorn poppers and sandwich makers.In 2006, the Betty Crocker catalog operation went out of business with
                         all of its inventory on sale. Points were redeemable until December 15, 2006. A new online store was launched in April 
                         2007 but discontinued sometime thereafter.

                    <p>Dunkaroos are a snack food from Betty Crocker, first launched in 1990. It consists of a snack-sized package containing cookies and frosting;
                        as the name implies, the cookies are meant to be dunked into the frosting before eating. Individual snack packages contain about ten 
                        small cookies and one cubic inch of frosting. The cookies are made in a variety of shapes, including a circle with an uppercase "D" 
                        in the center (the only shape featured in the 2020 version), feet, the mascot in different poses, and a hot air balloon.</p>

            <h3>Story of our Betty Crocker.</h3>
            <p>Betty Crocker is not a real person but has been created with imagination. Actresses once portrayed her on radio shows and on television answering the questions and fixing 
                the problems of real mid-century housewives. But Betty herself is a fictional creation, one that 
                looms over the American cultural identity like a housewife's hallucination of her kids' favorite 
                cartoon character (that just happens to have a great recipe for biscuits).</p>
            <h3>Official Reviews of our CookBook</h3>
            <p>The food that resulted from these recipes was the best, most solidly American food I have eaten in a really long time. 
                The macaroni and cheese was just plain macaroni and cheese. It didn't have anything extra it in, no tricks up its sleeve, 
                no bacon, no Sriracha. Just elbow macaroni, white sauce, and sharp cheddar. It was achingly perfect in its simplicity.Also, it 
            was easy to make delicious and simple recipes by taking guidance of the book.</p>
            <h3>What makes our product so Tasty!!</h3>
                    <p>The tremendous amount of support by our customers and fans has uplifted the betty crocker even when the time
                        was not really good; the trust and love by fans has always been a motivating role for us and we APPRECIATE to our
                        each and every customer for keeping faith in us everytime. Therefore, we take care of our product by giving them special
                        treatment and hence the products are always fresh and smells good.
