                Dunkaroos are a snack food from Betty Crocker, first launched in 1990. It consists of a snack-sized package containing cookies and frosting;
                as the name implies, the cookies are meant to be dunked into the frosting before eating. Individual snack packages contain about ten 
                small cookies and one cubic inch of frosting. The cookies are made in a variety of shapes, including a circle with an uppercase "D" 
                in the center (the only shape featured in the 2020 version), feet, the mascot in different poses, and a hot air balloon.
