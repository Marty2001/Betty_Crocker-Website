                By the early 1940s, surveys showed that the name Betty Crocker was known to 
                nine out of ten American homemakers. According to Fortune magazine in April 1945, 
                she was the second best-known woman in America, followed by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.
                Betty Crocker became known as the First Lady of Food and in that position was called upon to help her country.

                In 1945, at the request of the U.S. Office of War Information, Betty Crocker broadcast 
                a radio program called, "Our Nation's Rations" to help homemakers make the most of rationed 
                foods. Almost seven million copies of a Betty Crocker wartime booklet, "Your Share," were 
                distributed at this time. Another helpful Betty Crocker publication, "Thru Highway to Good 
                Nutrition," won national recognition by the American Red Cross for outstanding service in the national 
                interest.

                Just as food preferences, cooking methods and consumer interests have changed dramatically over the 
                years, so has Betty Crocker. She has changed her looks seven times over the past century. Portraits 
                were painted in 1936, 1955, 1965, 1969, 1972, 1980, 1986 and 1996. Over the years, her hairstyles and
                clothes have reflected the changing fashions of American women. Through it all, the goal has been to 
                present an image of Betty Crocker to which modern women can related, an image that recalls the promise 
                of thoroughly tested products and up-to-date recipes.
